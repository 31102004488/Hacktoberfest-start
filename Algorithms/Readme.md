# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS(C++)

## DISCLAMER
   1. Knowing a programming language and DSA are two different things .

      eg. you might be knowing python , c, c++ , java etc but if you know DSA then you can implement them in any programming language with minor syntatic modifications.

   2. This Repository does not intend to spoon feed , it can be used for studying in the right direction , but the efforts should be solely yours .

## WHY ?
  1. If you want to crack the interviews and get into the product based companies.
  2. Nearly everything functional in computer science is an implementation of data structure along with certain algorithms
  3. If you love to solve the real-world complex problems.
